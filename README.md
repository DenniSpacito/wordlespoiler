1.) Make a gmail account, make sure less secure apps is enabled. This allows the script to log into it. <br>
2.) Add the username and password to credentials.txt. (email on line one, password on line 2.) ex:

d90*nvnlke#

3.) Add the victim emails to victims.txt, just one email per line. <br>
4.) Now run the script. It will ask what wordle you'd like to spoil, and then automatically do it. Repeat as you wish.
